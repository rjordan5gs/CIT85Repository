    <p>Things you have now, things you've lost. People who're near by, people who've gone far away. 
        No matter what you choose, truth is, both regret and reluctance are goingto follow you around.
        You just have to make sure you don't make excuses to yourself down the road. </p>
    
        <p>As beasts are beneath human restraints, gods are above them... It would be foolish and untruthful to deny the appeal of exalted, godlike intoxication....
        We have seen the paradox that these godlike exalted moments often correspond to times when the men who have survived them say that they have acted like beasts....
        Above all, a sense of merely human virtue, a sense of being valued and of valuing anything seems to have fled their lives....
        However, all of our virtues come from not being gods. Generosity is meaningless to a god, who never suffers shortage or want. 
        Courage is meaningless to a god, who is immortal and can never suffer permanent injury. The godlike berserk state can destroy the capacity for virtue. 
        Whether the berserker is beneath humanity as an animal, above it as a god, or both, he is cut off from all human community when he is in this state.</p>
